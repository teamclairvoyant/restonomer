# Restonomer

Restonomer has been designed with a clear focus on solving the various data retrieval issues while fetching huge datasets from REST APIs that include:

* implementing an API-specific custom authentication mechanism

* implementing a solution for over-fetching and under-fetching of data

* implementing an API-specific pagination mechanism to retrieve complete data

* implementing an efficient auto retry mechanism in case of request failure

* implementing a fault-tolerant and highly performant solution that is scalable

* implementing an optimised solution that works in a concurrent and distributed fashion


Restonomer also provides users with a toolkit for transformation and persistence of the data that include:

* dealing with a variety of response data types (String / Bytes / Zipped)

* dealing with a variety of response data formats (JSON / CSV / XML)

* transforming the datasets into the required structure

* persisting the huge datasets to a specific storage system


Restonomer, at a high level, aims at providing users with a fault-tolerant and scalable solution to retrieve huge datasets from REST APIs, transform the datasets, and persist the datasets in a concurrent and distributed fashion.
